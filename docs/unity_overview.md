# Unity Overview

This page contains an overview of the Unity pong game implementation found here: [DWPongUnity](https://github.com/dangnicholas/DWPongUnity)

## Game Objects Overview
- **Main Camera**: The camera that the player sees
- **AI Camera**: The camera that is filtered to only see the top paddle and ball
- **Game Manager**: The game object that handles the basic game loop
- **Top Player**: The top paddle that the AI controls
- **Bottom Player**: The bottom paddle that the player controls
- **Ball**: A ball game object that can bounce on the bounds and paddles
- **Bounds**: Contains 4 game objects for each wall of the game
- **Quad**: The floor of the game
- **Canvas**: The canvas used for all the UI implementations

## Adjustable Settings
Some settings can be adjusted in the Unity editor

### Two options of sending game state to AI

**1. Send game state to AI using paddle and ball positions**
- AICamera > Game State To MQTT (Script) > Use Camera Gamestate (unchecked)

**2. Send game state to AI using snapshot of game and sending 2d array of 1s and 0s**
- AICamera > Game State To MQTT (Script) > Use Camera Gamestate (checked)

### Two options of AI frame inference intervals

**1. Sending the game state exactly every 5 frames**
- AICamera > Game State To MQTT (Script) > Responsive Frame Inference (unchecked)
- AICamera > Top Player > Responsive Frame Inference (unchecked)

**2. Sending the game state responsively immediately after AI inference**
- AICamera > Game State To MQTT (Script) > Responsive Frame Inference (checked)
- AICamera > Top Player > Responsive Frame Inference (checked)

### Changing the ball settings
- Ball
  - Launch Speed: The initial speed of ball
  - Max Speed: The maximum speed of the ball

### Changing the paddle settings
- (Top/Bottom) Player
   - Speed: The speed of the paddle
   - Max Offset: The max position the AI can move from origin
